## Project Overview

The equatorward flowing Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) bifurcates as it interacts with the shallow topography and dynamical complexity of the Tail of the Grand Banks (TGB) south of Newfoundland. Some portion of the DWBC is thought to continue onto the Scotian Shelf, eventually influencing the shelf circulation (and potentially the Gulf Stream). It’s not clear whether variability in the transport of the DWBC onto the Scotian Shelf is inherited from the DWBC further North (i.e., in the Labrador Sea), or whether it is a result of local processes at the TGB. In this project, I investigate the representation of the DWBC near the TGB (in both the mean and anomalous senses) using ECCOv4r4. The goals of the project are: 
* 1. Understand how much of the variability of DWBC flux onto the Scotian Shelf (across the East Face) is explained by the variability of the DWBC flux upstream of the TGB
  2. Identify mechanisms that drive the variability in DWBC volume transport, and investigate whether they differ between the north and south faces

## Data and Methods

### Data

Briefly describe and provide citations for the data that will be used (size, format, how to access).

### Existing methods

How would you or others traditionally try to address this problem? Provide any relevant citations to prior work.

### Proposed methods/tools

What new approaches would you like to implement for addressing your specific question(s) or application(s)?

Will your project use machine learning methods? If so, we invite you to create a [model card](model-card.md)!

### Additional resources or background reading

Optional: links to manuscripts or technical documents providing background information, context, or other relevant information.

## Project goals and tasks

### Project goals

List the specific project goals or research questions you want to answer. Think about what outcomes or deliverables you'd like to create (e.g. a series of tutorial notebooks demonstrating how to work with a dataset, results of an anaysis to answer a science question, an example of applying a new analysis method, or a new python package).

* Goal 1
* Goal 2
* ...

### Tasks

What are the individual tasks or steps that need to be taken to achieve each of the project goals identified above? What are the skills that participants will need or will learn and practice to complete each of these tasks? Think about which tasks are dependent on prior tasks, or which tasks can be performed in parallel.

* Task 1 (all team members will learn to use GitHub)
* Task 2 (team members will use the scikit-learn python library)
  * Task 2a (assigned to team member A)
  * Task 2b (assigned to team member B)
* Task 3
* ...

## Project Results

Use this section to briefly summarize your project results. This could take the form of describing the progress your team made to answering a research question, developing a tool or tutorial, interesting things found in exploring a new dataset, lessons learned for applying a new method, personal accomplishments of each team member, or anything else the team wants to share.

You could include figures or images here, links to notebooks or code elsewhere in the repository (such as in the [notebooks](notebooks/) folder), and information on how others can run your notebooks or code.
